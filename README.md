# TODO:
# The foundation is set. Thought is to have a string array with the corresponding letter, so that when something is entered, it will loop through the letters and put in the corresponding string ('b' -> 'bob'). We opted to have a view php file that handles what is seen. A bit more work but makes it easier to overview or change the other parts.

# Issues:
- Input with uppercase characters doesn't work.
